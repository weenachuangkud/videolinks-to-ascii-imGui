// dear imgui, v1.92.7 WIP
// (main code and documentation)

// Help:
// - Call and read ImGui::ShowDemoWindow() in imgui_demo.cpp. All applications in examples/ are doing that.
// - Read top of imgui.cpp for more details, links and comments.
// - Add '#define IMGUI_DEFINE_MATH_OPERATORS' before including imgui.h (or in imconfig.h) to access courtesy maths operators for ImVec2 and ImVec4.

// It is recommended that you don't modify imgui.cpp! It will become difficult for you to update the library.
// Note that 'ImGui::' being a namespace, you can add functions into the namespace from your own source files, without

// come with any guarantee of forward compatibility. Discussing your changes on the GitHub Issue Tracker may lead you
// to a better solution or official support for them.
